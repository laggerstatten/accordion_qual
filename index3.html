          <p class="a-line">In each of my three previous roles I was responsible for the organization of spatial data and GIS projects. I developed and maintained integration with customer, operations, and business databases which were part of other non-GIS systems. I have built reporting templates as simple as Google Sheets and as complex as live business intelligence dashboards.</p>

While at Floresville Electric, I used GIS and non-spatial analyses to compose an effective strategy to deploy remote-read meters across the service area to increase accuracy and reduce labor costs.</p>

          <p class="a-line">I started my career as a basic cartographer and have kept those skills up even while taking on advanced responsibilities. Great analysis isn't any good if it can't be communicated to the decision-makers who need it. Since 2018, I have invested more in my professional development by taking ~12 hours a year of community college design courses. I am now proficient in Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop, and InDesign. I use a deliberate eye when crafting deliverables for any audience.</p>
