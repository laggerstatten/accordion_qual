          <p class="a-line">In each of my three previous roles I was responsible for the organization of spatial data and GIS projects. I developed and maintained integration with customer, operations, and business databases which were part of other non-GIS systems. I have built reporting templates as simple as Google Sheets and as complex as live business intelligence dashboards. I'm ready to work with all departments of Whataburger to integrate data and turn it into insight.</p>

          <p class="a-line">During my time at SilverTip Energy, I used GIS to develop a strategy for efficient mineral rights acquisitions  in order to site wells in locations with little available acreage. While at Floresville Electric, I used GIS and non-spatial analyses to compose an effective strategy to deploy remote-read meters across the service area to increase accuracy and reduce labor costs. I'm excited to bring these experiences to Whataburger to solve problems at all spatial scales.</p>

          <p class="a-line">I started my career as a basic cartographer and have kept those skills up even while taking on advanced responsibilities. Great analysis isn't any good if it can't be communicated to the decision-makers who need it. Since 2018, I have invested more in my professional development by taking ~12 hours a year of community college design courses. I am now proficient in Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop, and InDesign. I use a deliberate eye when crafting deliverables for any audience.</p>

          <p class="a-line">This has been part of my GIS experience in every role I have held. Being able to use the power of GIS and spatial reasoning to solve tough problems is what keeps me in this field. One of my key motivators is the thrill of looking at a tough problem, struggling to find the right workflow to solve it, and then finding the right combination and order of steps to turn a mess of data into insight. I hope to discover many problems and even more solutions at Whataburger.</p>
